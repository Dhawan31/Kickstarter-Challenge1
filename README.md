# Analysis of Kickstarter-Challenge1
## Overview of Kickstarter Challenge-1
To present a data visualization of campaign outcomes that are based on launch dates and there funding goals.
### Purpose
This project goes over the dataset to check how different campaigns performed in relation to there launch dates and funding outcome goals.
### Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was done by creating the line charts. The first line chart represents the Theatre outcomes based on the launch date which gives us information about how campaigns performed in theatres depending on the launch date.

### Challenges and difficulties encountered
 Using the COUNTIFS() function in Excel when creating a worksheet for the outcomes based on the goal was a challenge. As I did unerstand the question being asked using the query for the first time and putting the criteria was a bit challenging.
 Tried to take help from the online forums and watching videos on how to apply the condintions but was facing difficulties. Then I was able to resolve and understand the COUNTIF by taking help from one of my coursemate.
 
 ## Results
 ### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 1. The month of May had the highest number of theater outcomes.
 2. There were no canceled Camoaigns in the month of october.
 
 ### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 1. When the goal is less than $1000 for plays the percentage is the highest for succesful .
 2. When the Goals is more than $50000 for both the Failed and succesful outcome the Percentage is 100 and 0 respectively showing that the more the Amount of goal money is high are the chances of failure or zero success rate.
 
 ### Limitations of the Dataset
 1.The Missing value for canceled outcome for some catgeories
 2. The wrong data types for some of the Data.
 3. Some of the columns like staff_pick and Spotlight just mention true and False the column headings are unclear of what it is representing.
 
 ### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  1. We could create table based on the Currency and country for the outcome.
  2. We could aslo create a table based on how much money was pledged vs how much the goal reached in a period of time for category of plays.
  
  ### For graphs
  We could create a bar graph for ease of understanding we can create a stacked bar graph for outcomes based on goals.
